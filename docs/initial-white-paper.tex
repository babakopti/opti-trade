\section{Introduction}\label{section:introduction}

The usual approach to predicting price of an asset is to regress the
historical prices of tat asset against a set of economic
indicators. The problem with this approach is that we still need
knowldege of the future values of economic indicators. This is done by
relying on estimate forecasts of econimic indicators which are often
based on qualitative methods, such as those in Blue Chip Economic
Indicators and Blue Chip Financial Forecasts~\cite{ref:blue-chip}. The
forecasts in Blue Chip publications are based on surveying top
business economists in the United States.

An approach is proposed to forecast economic variables without
depending on future values of any economic indicators. We look at the
economy as a multi-demensional manifold; each dimension is an economic
variable. These variables can be marco-economic indicators or asset
prices. We refer to this manifold as an economic universe. The
observed values of economic variables in a time period form a path in
this universe. We refer to this path as the economic path. We then
find a manifold for which this path is a geodesic, governed by a
system of differential equations. The fututre value of economc
variables can be predicted by solving this system of differential
equations.

In what follows the mathematical framework used is discussed and a
methodology is proposed to infer the structure of economic universe
given a set of observed economic variables.

\section{Mathematical Framework}\label{section:mathematical-framework}

Let us consider $n$ variables $x{1}$ to $x^{n}$ that are smooth
functions of time $t$; $x^{i} = x^{i}(t)$. Moreover, let us consider a
smooth real manifold $M$ equipped with $(x^{1},x^{2},...,x^{n})$ as a
coordinate system. Each set of coordinate values
$(x^{1}(t),...,x^{n}(t))$ denotes a point $p$ on $M$. Values of these
$n$ variables over a period of time $[0,T]$ form a path over $M$. This
path is smooth as $x^{i}$s are smooth functions of time. Now let us
add a constraint on $M$ by assuming that the path formed by
$x^{i}(t)$s is a geodesic of $M$. With this assumption, this path is
governed by the follwoing system of ordinary differential equations,

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:geodesic}
\ddot{x}^{m} + \Gamma^{m}_{ab} \dot{x}^{a} \dot{x}^{b} = 0
\end{equation}

The Christoffel symbols $Gamma^{m}_{ab}$ are in general functions of
coordinates. In the current work, we assume that Christoffel symbols
are constant. This is a sufficient (but not necessary) condition for
the manifold to have a constant curvature. This assumption is rather
strong and as such we should revisit this subject.

To further simplify the problem, we assume that variables of interest
are in fact $y^{m} = \frac{dx^{m}}{dt}$. This will allow us to work
with a set of first order ODEs,

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:geodesic-1st-order}
\dot{y}^{m} + \Gamma^{m}_{ab} y^{a} y^{b} = 0
\end{equation}

The above system of ODEs needs a boundary condition,

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:geodesic-bc}
\dot{y}^{m}(t_{BC}) = \dot{y}^{m}_{0}
\end{equation}

where $m,a,b \in [1,n] \cap \mathbb{N}$, and $t_{BC}$ is the time at
which a boundary condition is set.

Now, let us further assume that the values of variables $y^{m}(t)$ are
known for $t \in [0,T]$. Using this a set of training data, we can
determine $Gamma^{m}_{ab}$ by fitting Eq.~\ref{eqn:geodesic-1st-order}
over the training data.
