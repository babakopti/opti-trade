Design of a trading daemon:

We need to design and implement a daemon that runs continously and
performs the following with a certain cadence, for most likely daily,

1) Build a manifold model with a set of known variables which include
the pool of assets in our portfolio. This is done using MfdMod object.

2) Using the results of the model and the MfdPrt object, get portfolio
weghts.

3) Write the results of of (2) to a file, perhaps a pickled hash
table.

4) Send a notification to the user that they need to run the
authentication script.

In addition we need a user authentication script, as metioned in (4)
above. The script does the following:

1) Read the file generated in (3) above.

2) Read the current holdings. Convert the portfolio weights to the
quantity that we should long/ short for each asset.

3) Perform the actual trading. Authentication needed by the user.
