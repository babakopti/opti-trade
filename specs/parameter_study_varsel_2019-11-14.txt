1) Model sensitivity tests:

Model parameters:

   training period for model
   regularization parameter
   optimization tolerance
   attenuation coeffcient

we will need to look at the following:

   in-sample relative error vs. training period
   out-of-sample relative error vs. training period
   trend match count vs. training period

   in-sample relative error vs. optimization tolerance
   out-of-sample relative error vs. optimization tolerance
   trend match count vs. optimization tolerance

   out-of-sample relative error vs. regularization parameter
   trend match count vs. regularization parameter

   out-of-sample relative error vs. attenuation coeffcient
   trend match count vs. attenuation coeffcient

We should do this with several models.

2) Plot norm of Gamma vs. time (from backtest models). Also plot some
individual elements of Gamma vs. time.

3) Portfolio builder sensitivity tests

Portfolio parameters:

   MAD optimization tolerance
   period for MAD

We should generate the following plots:

    asset allocations vs. MAD optimization tolerance	
    asset allocations vs. period for MAD

4) Test different fallback strategies:

   a) Sign flipping
   b) MACD
   c) MSDP (mean / standar deviation)
   d) RLS (relative strength)
   e) No fallback

We should plot returns over a period for all the above fallback
strategies. Or plot trend predictiin success rate.

5) Variable selection strategy for model

   Results of 2 can be perhaps useful
   
6) Asset selection strategy for portfolio builder
